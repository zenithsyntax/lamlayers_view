- File Viewer: `https://lambook-view.web.app/#/lambook-view/?file=YOUR_FILE_URL`

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Update Google Search Console Verification Code
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your property: `lambook-view.web.app`
3. Choose "HTML tag" verification method
4. Copy the verification code from the meta tag
5. Open `web/index.html`
6. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE` with your actual verification code

### Step 2: Build the Web Application
```bash
flutter build web
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `build/web` directory.

### Step 3: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
1. Visit `https://lambook-view.web.app/` to verify the homepage loads correctly
2. Check that the footer shows Privacy Policy and Terms links
3. Click the Privacy Policy link and verify it loads at `/#/privacy`
4. Click the Terms of Service link and verify it loads at `/#/terms`
5. Verify the Google Search Console verification tag is present in the page source

### Step 5: Test Google OAuth Verification Requirements
1. Visit the homepage at `https://lambook-view.web.app/` (not with `#/home`)
2. Verify Google's crawler can see the homepage content
3. Verify the Privacy Policy link is visible on the homepage
4. Verify clicking the link works correctly

## Verification Checklist for Google OAuth

- ✅ Homepage loads at `https://lambook-view.web.app/` (without hash route)
- ✅ Homepage includes visible link to Privacy Policy
- ✅ Privacy Policy accessible at `https://lambook-view.web.app/#/privacy`
- ✅ Terms of Service accessible at `https://lambook-view.web.app/#/terms`
- ✅ Privacy Policy includes Google OAuth requirements
- ✅ Contact email (zenithsyntax@gmail.com) is present
- ✅ Google user data handling information included
- ✅ Google Search Console verification meta tag added

## Important Notes

1. **Hash Routes**: Flutter web uses hash-based routing by default (`#/privacy`), which is fine for Google verification as long as the links are visible on the homepage.

2. **Google Crawling**: Google's crawler will index the homepage content. The Privacy Policy link needs to be visible in the HTML when the page loads.

3. **Verification Timeline**: Google OAuth verification can take several days to weeks for review. Make sure all requirements are met before resubmitting.

4. **Responsive Design**: All pages are fully responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

5. **Existing Content**: The Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages already contained comprehensive, production-ready content that meets Google's requirements. They were already implemented in the codebase.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Homepage doesn't load correctly
- **Solution**: Make sure you ran `flutter build web` before deploying

### Issue: Links don't work after deployment
- **Solution**: Check that the build was successful and Firebase deployment completed without errors

### Issue: Google can't verify the site
- **Solution**: 
  1. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
  2. Verify the meta tag is correct in the deployed HTML
  3. Check that the homepage is accessible without authentication

### Issue: Privacy Policy link not visible
- **Solution**: Check the deployed site's page source and verify the footer HTML is present
